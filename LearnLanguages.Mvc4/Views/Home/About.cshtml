<p>Here at Ibgib, we are just a small company with one big idea: To Learn Everything in a Really Efficient and Nerdy Way.</p>

<p>Whatever the subject matter, whatever the information, whatever the niche, whatever the *Data*...We want to use everything
   at our sciency, nerdy disposal to maximize the little grey cells capabilities to *OWN* that information. </p>

<p>But if we're not smart about it, if we're not nerdy about it, if we don't use a Sciency method, then we know the 
  consequence, because we all know the saying: Use it or lose it! Or how I like to put it: The dreaded LEARN:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn</li>
  <li>Everything</li>
  <li>And</li>
  <li>Remember</li>
  <li>Nothing</li>
</ul>

<p>But Alas! There is HOPE! Ibgib is dedicated to fighting this cognitive bias of 
  forgetfulness...this invisible thief with the quick fingers, dipping into our brain buckets and stealing our encephalodata; 
  feasting on our poor little grey cellular ones and zeroes...Be Gone Ye Sneakie Daemon!</p>

<p>Ibgib is all about beating away that demon and fighting back with whatever means necessary. We want our knowledge!
  We don't want to just "LEARN" it. Rather, we want to *Remember* the data. We want to *Recall* the data. We want to 
  *Maintain* the data. We want to cuddle it in our protective arms and drop-kick the hell out of the sneakthief.</p>

<p>This is one interpretation - one ib - of Ibgib.</p>
